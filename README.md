# Predicting Sophomore Seasons: Alvin-Kamara
Comparing Alvin Kamara's rookie season to the rookie season of every NFL running back since 1950 to predict second season success.  
### Strategy  
I parsed through the JSON file containing the statlines for every player from every NFL game since 1950 to get a dataset containing the statline of the rookie season of every NFL running back since then. With this data, I compared every rookie season to that of Alvin Kamara's by attempting to match both efficiency and opportunity. To do this, I equally weighted yards per rush, yards per reception, rushing yards per game, receiving yards per game, touchdowns per rush, touchdowns per reception, rushing touchdowns per game, and receiving touchdowns per game. After comparing these stats, I came away with the 5 players who had rookie seasons most similar to Kamara's, and the similarity ratings that go with them.

### Second Year Outcomes

By looking at the second year stats of these 5 players, I tried to determine how Kamara's second year would go. In 1 point per reception leagues (PPR), the worst sophomore season among these 5 players is held by Kelvin Bryant, who managed 168.6 points over 11 games, for an average of 15.3 per game. The best sophomore season among these 5 players is held by David Johnson, who managed 411.8 points over 16 games, for an average of 25.7 per game. Finally, when comparing the sophomore seasons of all 5 of these running backs together, Kamara is projected for 19.8 points per game, which is good for 317 points over a healthy 16 game season. This would have been the third best RB in 2017.
