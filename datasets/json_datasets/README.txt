Original JSON datasets are too big for github storage. If you would like to obtain them, you can download them here: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/nfl-football-player-stats
Note: If you would like to reuse my code with these datasets, you will need to rename the downloaded JSON datasets to "games.json" and "profiles.json" and store them in this directory.
